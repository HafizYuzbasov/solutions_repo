# Problem 1

# Projectile Motion

**Projectile motion** refers to the motion of an object that is thrown or projected into the air, influenced only by the force of gravity (and air resistance, which is typically neglected in basic calculations). The object follows a curved trajectory known as a **parabola**.

## Key Concepts

1. **Trajectory**: The path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory. It is generally a curve, and its shape depends on the initial velocity, the angle of projection, and the acceleration due to gravity.

2. **Components of Motion**:
   - **Horizontal motion**: In projectile motion, the horizontal velocity is constant (assuming no air resistance).
   - **Vertical motion**: The vertical velocity changes due to the acceleration caused by gravity.

### Equations of Motion

For an object in projectile motion, we divide the motion into **horizontal** and **vertical** components:

1. **Horizontal Motion**:
   \[
   x(t) = v_0 \cdot \cos(\theta) \cdot t
   \]
   where:

   - \( x(t) \) is the horizontal distance traveled at time \( t \),
   - \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity,
   - \( \theta \) is the angle of projection,
   - \( t \) is the time elapsed.

2. **Vertical Motion**:
   \[
   y(t) = v_0 \cdot \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
   \]
   where:
   - \( y(t) \) is the vertical displacement at time \( t \),
   - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²).

### Time of Flight

The time the projectile remains in the air is determined by the vertical motion. The total time of flight is given by:

\[
T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
\]

### Maximum Height

The maximum height \( H \) reached by the projectile is given by:

\[
H = \frac{(v_0 \sin(\theta))^2}{2g}
\]

### Range

The horizontal distance traveled by the projectile (or **range**) is:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

## Example

Consider a projectile with an initial velocity of 20 m/s and an angle of 30°.

1. **Time of flight**:  
   \[
   T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
   \]

2. **Maximum height**:
   \[
   H = \frac{(20 \times \sin(30^\circ))^2}{2 \times 9.8} \approx 5.1 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Range**:
   \[
   R = \frac{20^2 \times \sin(60^\circ)}{9.8} \approx 34.64 \text{ meters}
   \]

## Factors Affecting Projectile Motion

1. **Initial Velocity**: The higher the initial velocity, the farther the projectile will travel.
2. **Angle of Projection**: The angle at which the object is projected affects the range and height.
   - A launch angle of 45° gives the maximum range.
3. **Gravity**: The stronger the gravitational pull, the shorter the range and height.
4. **Air Resistance**: In the real world, air resistance will slow down the projectile and decrease its range and maximum height.

## Conclusion

Projectile motion is an essential concept in physics that describes the motion of objects under the influence of gravity. By understanding the basic equations and factors that affect projectile motion, we can predict and analyze the behavior of projectiles in various situations.
