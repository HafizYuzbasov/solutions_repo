# Problem 1

Understanding Projectile Motion
When an object is launched into the air at an angle (without air resistance), it follows a parabolic path due to the influence of gravity.

We break this motion into two independent components:

Horizontal motion → Moves at a constant velocity (no acceleration).
Vertical motion → Affected by gravity (accelerates downward at 𝑔 = 9.8 /𝑠<sup>2</sup>).

Each of these components follows different equations.
