# Problem 1

Projectile Motion

Projectile motion describes the motion of an object launched into the air, moving under the influence of gravity. It follows a curved path known as a parabola.

Key Concepts

1. Components of Motion

Projectile motion consists of two independent components:

Horizontal Motion: The object moves at a constant velocity because there are no horizontal forces (neglecting air resistance).

Vertical Motion: The object accelerates downward due to gravity (9.8 m/sÂ² on Earth).

Derivation of Governing Equations

1. Fundamental Principles

Newton's Second Law states:

For projectile motion, the only force acting (neglecting air resistance) is gravity. We analyze motion in two perpendicular directions:

Horizontal Motion: No acceleration (constant velocity).

Vertical Motion: Acceleration due to gravity (acting downward).

Decomposing the initial velocity into components:

where is the launch angle.

2. Differential Equations of Motion

Horizontal Motion

Since no horizontal force acts on the projectile:

Integrating once:

Integrating again:

This confirms that horizontal motion is uniform (constant velocity).

Vertical Motion

Since the only force is gravity , we write:

Integrating once:

Integrating again:

This describes vertical displacement as a function of time.

3. Time of Flight

The projectile lands when . Setting the vertical equation to zero:

Factoring :

Solving for :

4. Range of the Projectile

Using , we substitute :

Using the identity :

This equation shows that range depends on launch angle and initial speed .

5. Family of Solutions

By varying the initial conditions (, ), we get different trajectories:

Increasing increases range and height.

Adjusting changes trajectory shape.

Different launch heights modify flight time.

Applications

Projectile motion applies to:

Sports (football, basketball)

Ballistics (bullets, rockets)

Engineering (trajectory planning)
