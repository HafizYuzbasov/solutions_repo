# Investigation of the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

Projectile motion is governed by the basic equations of motion under constant acceleration due to gravity. To derive the equations, we consider two components of motion: horizontal (x-direction) and vertical (y-direction).

### 1.1 Equations of Motion

In projectile motion, the only force acting on the projectile (ignoring air resistance) is gravity, which accelerates the object downward with a constant acceleration, \( g \).

The horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. We can describe each with kinematic equations:

1. **Horizontal motion (no acceleration)**:
   \[
   x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t
   \]
   where:

   - \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity,
   - \( \theta \) is the angle of projection,
   - \( t \) is time.

2. **Vertical motion (constant acceleration due to gravity)**:
   \[
   y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
   \]

### 1.2 Time of Flight

To find the time of flight, we need to determine when the projectile hits the ground, i.e., when \( y(t) = 0 \). Using the vertical motion equation:
\[
y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = 0
\]

Factoring out \( t \), we get:
\[
t (v_0 \sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2} g t) = 0
\]
The solutions are \( t = 0 \) (the initial launch) and \( t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \) (the time when the projectile hits the ground).

Thus, the time of flight is:
\[
t_f = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
\]

### 1.3 Horizontal Range

The horizontal range \( R \) is the distance traveled in the horizontal direction during the time of flight. From the horizontal motion equation:
\[
R = x(t_f) = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t_f
\]
Substituting the expression for \( t_f \):
\[
R = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

### 1.4 Family of Solutions

This equation shows how the range \( R \) depends on the initial velocity \( v_0 \), the gravitational acceleration \( g \), and the launch angle \( \theta \). The term \( \sin(2\theta) \) shows that the range is maximized when \( \theta = 45^\circ \) because \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \).

Thus, for a given \( v_0 \) and \( g \), the range depends on the launch angle. The solution also highlights that the range is symmetric: for any angle \( \theta \), there is a complementary angle \( 90^\circ - \theta \) that gives the same range.

## 2. Analysis of the Range

### 2.1 Dependence on Launch Angle

From the derived equation \( R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} \), we can see that the horizontal range is a function of \( \sin(2\theta) \). Therefore, the range is:

- Maximized at \( \theta = 45^\circ \), where \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \).
- Zero at \( \theta = 0^\circ \) and \( \theta = 90^\circ \), since \( \sin(0^\circ) = 0 \) and \( \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \).
- Symmetrical around \( \theta = 45^\circ \).

### 2.2 Dependence on Initial Velocity and Gravitational Acceleration

From the equation for the range, we observe that the range \( R \) is directly proportional to the square of the initial velocity \( v_0 \) and inversely proportional to the gravitational acceleration \( g \). Therefore:

- **Initial velocity**: As \( v_0 \) increases, the range increases quadratically. This implies that doubling the initial velocity quadruples the range.
- **Gravitational acceleration**: The range decreases with an increase in gravitational acceleration, so on a planet with stronger gravity, the range of a projectile would be shorter.

## 3. Practical Applications

This model is a simplified version of projectile motion, which assumes no air resistance and level ground. In real-world applications, several factors influence projectile motion:

- **Air resistance**: Drag forces reduce the horizontal range and make the trajectory curve differently. The more streamlined the projectile, the less drag it experiences.
- **Uneven terrain**: The model assumes level ground, but if the projectile is launched at an incline or on a hill, the calculations become more complex.
- **Wind**: Wind can modify both the trajectory and range by altering the horizontal velocity of the projectile.

## 4. Implementation

Below is a Python script to simulate projectile motion and visualize the range as a function of the launch angle for different initial velocities.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
g = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)

# Function to calculate the range based on angle and initial velocity
def calculate_range(v0, angle):
    # Convert angle to radians
    theta = np.radians(angle)
    # Range formula
    R = (v0**2 * np.sin(2*theta)) / g
    return R

# Generate data for multiple initial velocities
initial_velocities = [20, 30, 40, 50]  # Different initial velocities in m/s
angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100)  # Angles from 0 to 90 degrees

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
for v0 in initial_velocities:
    ranges = [calculate_range(v0, angle) for angle in angles]
    plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s')

plt.title('Projectile Range vs Launch Angle')
plt.xlabel('Launch Angle (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range (meters)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
