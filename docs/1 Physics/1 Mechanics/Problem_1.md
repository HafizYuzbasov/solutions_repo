## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### Governing Equations of Motion

Projectile motion is a combination of horizontal and vertical motion. We start with the following two key equations:

#### Horizontal Motion:

\[
x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) t
\]
where:

- \( x(t) \) is the horizontal displacement at time \( t \),
- \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity,
- \( \theta \) is the angle of projection,
- \( t \) is the time.

#### Vertical Motion:

\[
y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]
where:

- \( y(t) \) is the vertical displacement at time \( t \),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

### Time of Flight

To find the time of flight, set the vertical displacement equal to zero when the projectile reaches the ground (\( y(t) = 0 \)).

\[
0 = v*0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]
Solving for \( t \), the time of flight is:
\[
t*{\text{flight}} = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
\]

### Horizontal Range

The horizontal range \( R \) is the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile, occurring at the time \( t\_{\text{flight}} \):

\[
R = v*0 \cos(\theta) t*{\text{flight}}
\]
Substituting \( t\_{\text{flight}} \) from the previous equation:
\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

This equation shows that the range \( R \) depends on the initial velocity \( v_0 \), the angle of projection \( \theta \), and the gravitational acceleration \( g \).

### Family of Solutions

The solution to the motion of the projectile is governed by the initial conditions, \( v_0 \) and \( \theta \). By varying these parameters, we obtain different trajectories and ranges. The horizontal range is maximized when \( \theta = 45^\circ \), because the sine function \( \sin(2\theta) \) is maximized at this angle.

---

## 2. Analysis of the Range

The equation for the range \( R \) is:
\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

### Dependency on the Angle of Projection

The range of the projectile is a function of \( \theta \), and \( \sin(2\theta) \) varies as follows:

- As \( \theta \) increases, \( \sin(2\theta) \) increases, reaches a maximum at \( \theta = 45^\circ \), and then decreases.
- Thus, the range is maximized when the angle of projection is 45 degrees.

### Influence of Other Parameters

- **Initial Velocity (\( v_0 \))**: The range increases with the square of the initial velocity, as it appears quadratically in the range equation.
- **Gravitational Acceleration (\( g \))**: The range is inversely proportional to gravitational acceleration. On planets with lower gravity, the range will be larger for the same initial velocity and angle.

---

## 3. Practical Applications

In real-world scenarios, other factors influence projectile motion:

- **Uneven Terrain**: If the projectile is launched from or lands at different heights, modifications to the equations are required to account for the difference in initial or final heights.
- **Air Resistance**: In the presence of air resistance, the projectile's motion becomes more complex. The drag force depends on the velocity and shape of the projectile, and solving the equations requires numerical methods.

---

## 4. Implementation

The range of a projectile can be simulated using Python. The following script calculates and visualizes the range as a function of the launch angle.

### Python Code

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define constants
g = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2
v_0 = 20  # initial velocity in m/s

# Define function to calculate range
def range_of_projectile(v_0, theta):
    return (v_0**2 * np.sin(2 * np.radians(theta))) / g

# Create an array of angles
angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100)

# Calculate the range for each angle
ranges = [range_of_projectile(v_0, angle) for angle in angles]

# Plot the range vs. angle
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f'v0 = {v_0} m/s', color='blue')
plt.title('Range of a Projectile vs. Angle of Projection')
plt.xlabel('Angle of Projection (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range (meters)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
