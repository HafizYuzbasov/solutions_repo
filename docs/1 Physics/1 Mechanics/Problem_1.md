# Problem 1

Projectile motion describes the motion of an object launched into the air, moving under the influence of gravity. It follows a curved path known as a parabola.

Key Concepts

1. Components of Motion

Projectile motion consists of two independent components:

1.1.Horizontal Motion: The object moves at a constant velocity because there are no horizontal forces (neglecting air resistance).

1.2.Vertical Motion: The object accelerates downward due to gravity (9.8 m/sÂ² on Earth).
