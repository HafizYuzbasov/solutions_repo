### Forced Damped Pendulum: Small-Angle Approximation

The **forced damped pendulum** is governed by the following second-order differential equation:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \sin(\theta) = F_0 \cos(\omega t)
$$

Where:

- \( \theta(t) \) is the angular displacement,
- \( \beta \) is the damping coefficient,
- \( \omega_0 \) is the natural frequency of the pendulum (for small angles),
- \( F_0 \) is the amplitude of the driving force,
- \( \omega \) is the driving frequency,
- \( \sin(\theta) \approx \theta \) for small angles.

### Small-Angle Approximation

For small angles (\( \theta \approx 0 \)), \( \sin(\theta) \approx \theta \), so the equation simplifies to:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = F_0 \cos(\omega t)
$$

This is a standard **forced damped harmonic oscillator** equation.

### Solution to the Differential Equation

The solution consists of two parts:

1. **Homogeneous Solution (Undriven)**: The general solution to the homogeneous equation \( \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = 0 \) is:

$$
\theta_h(t) = A e^{-\beta t} \cos(\omega_d t + \phi)
$$

Where \( \omega_d = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2} \) is the damped frequency.

2. **Particular Solution (Driven)**: The particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation \( \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + 2\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = F_0 \cos(\omega t) \) is:

$$
\theta_p(t) = \frac{F_0}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2} \cos(\omega t)
$$

Thus, the total solution is the sum of both:

$$
\theta(t) = \theta_h(t) + \theta_p(t)
$$

### Resonance Conditions

**Resonance** occurs when the driving frequency \( \omega \) matches the natural frequency \( \omega_0 \) of the system, i.e., \( \omega = \omega_0 \). At resonance, the system experiences maximum amplitude oscillations, which can lead to large oscillations and potential system failure due to energy buildup.

### Energy Implications

- **Non-Resonant Case**: When \( \omega \neq \omega_0 \), the system oscillates with an amplitude determined by the balance between the driving force and damping.
- **Resonance**: At resonance, the energy transfer from the driving force to the pendulum is maximized, leading to a significant increase in amplitude. If damping is small, the system can oscillate with large amplitude for long durations, which can result in high energy accumulation.
