The governing equations of motion can be derived from Newton's second law of motion. Consider the following: Horizontal Motion : In the absence of horizontal forces, the horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the projectile\u2019s flight. The horizontal displacement \\( x(t) \\) as a function of time \\( t \\) is given by: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t $$ where: - \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity of the projectile - \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of projection - \\( t \\) is the time elapsed Vertical Motion : In the vertical direction, the only force acting is gravity. The vertical displacement \\( y(t) \\) is described by the second-order differential equation: $$ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g $$ Integrating once gives the vertical velocity: $$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - g \\cdot t $$ Integrating again to find the vertical displacement: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g \\cdot t^2 $$ Time of Flight To find the time of flight, we solve for \\( t \\) when the projectile lands, i.e., when \\( y(t) = 0 \\) . From the vertical displacement equation: \\[ v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g \\cdot t^2 = 0 \\] Factoring out \\( t \\) , we get: \\[ t \\left( v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g \\cdot t \\right) = 0 \\] The nontrivial solution is: \\[ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Thus, the time of flight \\( T \\) is: \\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Horizontal Range The horizontal range \\( R \\) is the horizontal distance the projectile travels during its flight. Using the time of flight, we can calculate \\( R \\) : \\[ R = x(T) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot T \\] Substituting for \\( T \\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Simplifying: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Variations in Initial Conditions The range \\( R \\) depends on both the initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) and the angle of projection \\( \\theta \\) . By analyzing this equation, we can see how variations in these initial conditions lead to a family of solutions: Initial Velocity \\( v_0 \\) : A higher initial velocity leads to a larger range.
