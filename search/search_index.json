Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is governed by Newton's laws and can be modeled by decomposing the motion into horizontal and vertical components. Given: - Initial velocity: \\( \\(v_0\\) \\) - Angle of projection: \\( \\(\\theta\\) \\) - Gravitational acceleration: \\( \\(g\\) \\) The equations of motion in a vacuum and with no air resistance are: Horizontal displacement: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t $$ Vertical displacement: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ The time of flight is obtained by solving \\( \\(y(t) = 0\\) \\) : \\[ t_{total} = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Using this, the range (horizontal distance traveled before hitting the ground) is: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t_{total} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] This equation shows a nonlinear dependence on angle, with a maximum range at \\( \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) \\) for ideal conditions. 2. Analysis of the Range We analyze the range \\( \\(R\\) \\) as a function of the angle of projection \\( \\(\\theta\\) \\) using: \\[ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Max range: Occurs when \\( \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\) \\) , i.e., \\( \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) \\) . Effect of velocity: Range increases quadratically with initial velocity. Effect of gravity: Range decreases inversely with gravitational acceleration. 3. Practical Applications In real-world situations: - Air resistance reduces range and shifts optimal angle < \\( \\(45^\\circ\\) \\) . - Uneven terrain alters landing height, changing total time of flight. - Wind can either assist or hinder horizontal displacement. - Applications include sports (e.g., basketball, soccer), military ballistics, and spaceflight trajectory planning. 4. Implementation Below is a Python implementation to visualize how the range depends on the angle of projection.
